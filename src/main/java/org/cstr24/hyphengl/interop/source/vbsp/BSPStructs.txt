    /* Reminders to self:
        - any time you're reading a `char` read it as a byte and cast.
        - valve's `byte` data type is an alias for an unsigned char. java's char is unsigned but
          they get widened to ints (signed type) when arithmeticc-ing. have to use shorts.
        - you enjoy this so keep doing it.
